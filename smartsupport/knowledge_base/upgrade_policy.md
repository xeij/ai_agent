## Upgrade Timing and Recommendations

### When to Upgrade Your GPU

**Upgrade Recommended If:**
- Your current GPU is 3+ generations old (e.g., GTX 1000 series)
- You're experiencing low frame rates in new games (below 60 FPS at your desired resolution)
- You want to enable ray tracing or use DLSS 3.0
- You're upgrading to a higher resolution monitor (1080p → 1440p or 4K)

**Popular Upgrade Paths:**
- GTX 1080 Ti → RTX 4070 Ti (3x performance increase)
- RTX 2080 Super → RTX 4080 (2.5x performance increase)
- RTX 3070 → RTX 4090 (2.2x performance increase)

**Compatibility Check:**
- Power supply wattage (we recommend 750W+ for RTX 4080/4090)
- Physical clearance in case
- PCIe slot availability (x16 slot required)

### When to Upgrade Your CPU

**Upgrade Recommended If:**
- CPU usage consistently at 100% during gaming or work
- Experiencing stuttering or frame drops despite good GPU
- Your CPU is 5+ years old
